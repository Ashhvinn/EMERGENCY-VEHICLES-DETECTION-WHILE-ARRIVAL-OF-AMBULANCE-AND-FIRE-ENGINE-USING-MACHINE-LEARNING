## Introduction

Emergency vehicle detection systems play a critical role in reducing response times and ensuring road safety. Using cutting-edge computer vision technologies, this project focuses on detecting emergency vehicles in real-time and facilitating their swift passage through traffic by managing signals and alerting road users.

---

## Project Objectives
- Develop a machine learning-based system to identify ambulances and fire engines.
- Optimize traffic management by dynamically adjusting signals.
- Provide real-time alerts to road users and traffic controllers.
- Enhance overall public safety and emergency response efficiency.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Identifies emergency vehicles in live traffic feeds using YOLOv3.
- **Dynamic Traffic Signal Control**: Automatically prioritizes emergency vehicles by adjusting traffic signals.
- **Public Notifications**: Alerts nearby road users of approaching emergency vehicles through visual and auditory signals.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays results using confusion matrices and other evaluation metrics.

---

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Custom dataset with annotated emergency and routine vehicles from traffic footage.
- **Classes**: Emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire engines) and non-emergency vehicles.
- **Size**: Thousands of labeled images from diverse traffic scenarios.

---

## Model Architecture
The system uses YOLOv3 for object detection due to its real-time performance and accuracy. Key components include:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts traffic images.
- **YOLO Detection Layers**: Divides images into grids and predicts bounding boxes for emergency vehicles.
- **Output Layer**: Provides the detection results.

### Sample Model Code
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from yolo import YOLO

yolo = YOLO(model_path="yolo.h5", classes_path="classes.txt", anchors_path="anchors.txt")

image = cv2.imread("traffic.jpg")
detections = yolo.detect_image(image)

print("Detected Objects:", detections)
```
